                        <h5>Welcome to Notre Dame College, an educational institute founded and administered by the
                            Congregation of Holy Cross which has been serving the nation with a long standing tradition of
                            excellence in academics, the Science, Business and Arts.</h5>
                        <h5>Education is considered to be the core instrument of human development. Our objective at Notre
                            Dame is the harmonious development of the intellectual, physical, social, moral and spiritual
                            faculties of the students. At the heart of the institution is a core of shared values, which
                            reflects our ethos and everything we do. These values foster high standards of behavior and
                            achievement, support a framework of respect, promote self-confidence and provide a warm,
                            harmonious environment in which our student learn and grow.</h5>
                        <h5>Our approach is student-centered and we believe that the approach to motivating and getting the
                            best out of the student is based on the positive reinforcement of good work and good behavior.
                            Our endeavor will be to ensure that student grow in their full potential and be competent to
                            take responsibility in all walks of life. We teach our student that nothing worthwhile can be
                            achieved without a sense of discipline and we expect our student to conform to high disciplinary
                            standards and cherish the values of tolerance, compassion, respect, obedient and independent
                            thinking.</h5>
                        <h5>Our faculty members aim to support, guide, encourage and teach our students to the best of their
                            ability. The parents can assuredly repose faith in the sincerity of purpose and dedication of
                            the faculty. I am confident that the students will find their educational experience at Notre
                            Dame College a fruitful and rewarding one.
